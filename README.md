# 625.661-Course-Project---Fall-2020
Repository for my Stat Models and Regression course project

This is the code for my class project. I would like to thank Mr. Ben Baldwin that created the nflfastR package that I used for my project. His dedication to that project is amazing.

Course_Project.Rmd is the R markdown file I used to create my project. It creates a large PDF file that takes a minute to process.  
Spare_Code. R is just an R script file where I dumped extra code I fiddled with.  
my_hearder.tex is a text file used to help center figures when creating a PDF.
